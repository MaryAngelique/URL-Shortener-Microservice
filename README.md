# URL Shortener Microservice

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

HINT: Do not forget to use a body parsing middleware to handle the POST requests. Also, you can use the function dns.lookup(host, cb) from the dns core module to verify a submitted URL.
